# Blockchain-based DNS System

Blockchain-Based DNS System is a complete implementation of a decentralized Domain Name System (DNS) service using blockchain technology. It provides a robust, trustless, and tamper-resistant DNS infrastructure by leveraging the consensus and immutability properties of blockchains.

This system has been **successfully tested** with multiple nodes, DNS record creation, blockchain mining, and consensus mechanisms.

## Features

- **Blockchain-backed DNS:** Every domain/IP mapping is stored as a transaction on a distributed ledger.
- **Consensus Mechanism:** Nodes use proof-of-work and consensus algorithm to ensure all maintain the same DNS records.
- **Rewards & Incentives:** Nodes receive coins for mining new blocks, incentivizing network participation.
- **REST API:** Easily interact with the service via HTTP endpoints.
- **DNS Protocol Integration:** Preliminary support for DNS packet resolution using `dnslib`.
- **Multi-node Network:** Tested with multiple nodes running simultaneously.
- **Automatic Synchronization:** Blockchain automatically syncs across all nodes in the network.

---

## How It Works

- Each DNS mapping (hostname â†’ IP/port) is a transaction.
- Transactions are buffered and, once enough accumulate, can be mined into a new block.
- Each node maintains a copy of the blockchain (the ledger) and synchronizes with others using a consensus algorithm (longest chain wins).
- Nodes can be started on different ports, simulating a distributed network.

# How to Run This Project

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   https://github.com/Manoj-Kumar-BV/BlockChain-Based-DNS-System.git
   cd BlockChain-Based-DNS-System
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Project

You can run multiple nodes to simulate a decentralized DNS network using different ports.

**Start a node on port 5001:**
```bash
python server.py -p 5001
```

**Start another node on port 5002:**
```bash
python server.py -p 5002
```

Each node will expose a REST API for adding DNS records, mining blocks, syncing with other nodes, and inspecting the blockchain state.

## Complete Working Example (TESTED)

Here's a complete step-by-step example that has been tested and verified to work:

### Step 1: Check if nodes are alive
```bash
# For Windows PowerShell (tested)
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:5000/debug/alive" -Method GET
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:5001/debug/alive" -Method GET

# For Linux/Mac
curl --request GET http://localhost:5000/debug/alive
curl --request GET http://localhost:5001/debug/alive
```

### Step 2: Register nodes with each other
```bash
# For Windows PowerShell (tested)
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:5000/nodes/new" -Method POST -ContentType "application/json" -Body '{"nodes": ["localhost:5001"]}'
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:5001/nodes/new" -Method POST -ContentType "application/json" -Body '{"nodes": ["localhost:5000"]}'

# For Linux/Mac
curl --request POST --url http://localhost:5000/nodes/new --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{"nodes": ["localhost:5001"]}'
curl --request POST --url http://localhost:5001/nodes/new --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{"nodes": ["localhost:5000"]}'
```

### Step 3: Add DNS mappings
```bash
# For Windows PowerShell (tested)
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:5000/dns/new" -Method POST -ContentType "application/json" -Body '{"entry1": {"hostname": "www.example.com", "ip": "1.2.3.4", "port": 80}}'
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:5000/dns/new" -Method POST -ContentType "application/json" -Body '{"entry1": {"hostname": "api.example.com", "ip": "5.6.7.8", "port": 443}}'

# For Linux/Mac
curl --request POST --url http://localhost:5000/dns/new --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{"entry1": {"hostname": "www.example.com", "ip": "1.2.3.4", "port": 80}}'
curl --request POST --url http://localhost:5000/dns/new --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{"entry1": {"hostname": "api.example.com", "ip": "5.6.7.8", "port": 443}}'
```

### Step 4: Mine a block
```bash
# For Windows PowerShell (tested)
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:5000/debug/force_block" -Method GET

# For Linux/Mac
curl --request GET http://localhost:5000/debug/force_block
```

### Step 5: Verify blockchain synchronization
```bash
# For Windows PowerShell (tested)
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:5000/debug/dump_chain" -Method GET
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:5001/debug/dump_chain" -Method GET

# For Linux/Mac
curl --request GET http://localhost:5000/debug/dump_chain
curl --request GET http://localhost:5001/debug/dump_chain
```

### Step 6: Test DNS resolution
```bash
# For Windows PowerShell (tested)
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:5000/dns/request" -Method POST -ContentType "application/json" -Body '{"hostname": "www.example.com"}'
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:5001/dns/request" -Method POST -ContentType "application/json" -Body '{"hostname": "api.example.com"}'

# For Linux/Mac
curl --request POST --url http://localhost:5000/dns/request --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{"hostname": "www.example.com"}'
curl --request POST --url http://localhost:5001/dns/request --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{"hostname": "api.example.com"}'
```

**Expected Results:**
- `www.example.com` resolves to `{"ip": "1.2.3.4", "port": 80}`
- `api.example.com` resolves to `{"ip": "5.6.7.8", "port": 443}`
